# Highway Traffic Incidents Detection From Waze Interactions
Early incident detection is of great value to help agencies make quick and timely responses to reduce and mitigate the effects of an incident. As road networks become more complex, and incidents may occur at any time and location, alternative, efficient, and effective ways to detect incidents are called for. In this article, we extracted incident information from Waze data, then compared these data with the official incident and validated them with travel time data. From the results, we found the percentage of official incidents data matched by Waze data is relatively high when allowing a reasonable time and distance variation. Also, a significant increase in travel time was found with the presence of incidents, demonstrating that Waze data holds great potential to serve as a complimentary incident data source in future decision-making.
