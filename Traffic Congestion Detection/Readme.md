## Traffic Congestion Detection
Traffic congestion has long been considered a critical issue since it harms people's lives and negatively affects the daily traffic operation. Most existing studies have explored traffic congestion patterns with data either from fixed sensors placed in the road (e.g., closed-circuit cameras, video recognition cameras, inductive loop sensors) or sensor technology within the vehicle (e.g., Global Positioning System (GPS), acceleration sensors). Few studies have been devoted to exploring the traffic congesting pattern with crowdsourcing data, like Waze, which is reliable and cost-effective. To fill this gap, this paper proposed a network-based spatial-temporal clustering approach that supports the detection of traffic congestion with crowdsourcing data. We demonstrated the applicability of our approach to real world problems with a case study of Knoxville, Tennessee.

## Methods
A novel network-based spatial-temporal clustering framework is proposed in this section to detect traffic congestion patterns with crowdsourcing data on a large scale road network. The proposed approach is based on the knowledge of the map matching algorithm, ST-DBSCAN, Dijkstra algorithm.
